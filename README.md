# Convolutional neural network for melanoma cancer detection 
The fight against cancer is one of the great challenges facing humanity. Specifically, for those dedicated to cancer research, both in investigating and understanding its existence and in developing effective treatments and drugs to combat its effects on health. 

In fact, according to the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM), they have increased deaths by 17.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. It is significant that tumors were the second cause of death with 22.8% of them being, infectious diseases responsible for 16.4% of deaths. Thus concluding that, cancer, in the year of the coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2), continued to cause more deaths than the disease caused by that virus, COVID-19.

In addition, it was estimated that 18.1 million new cases were diagnosed globally in 2020 and this figure is expected to increase by 49.2% by 2040, rising to 27 million cases of cancer [1].

# Proposed solution 
Fine-tunning of VGG16 model for benign or malign melanoma images. 

![_VGG16 architecture example_](https://github.com/luismerinou/final-degree-project-UPM/assets/64010057/249a476e-9fd1-4384-9edd-86d9f05f83cc) 

_VGG16 architecture example_


The architecture of the developed model is based on the VGGNet model, specifically the VGG16 model. VGGNet, a specific type of convolutional architecture highly recommended for image classification. The technique described above has been applied as transfer learning. Therefore, the original architecture of VGG16 has been modified architecture of VGG16 has been modified to adapt it to the problem at hand.


## Final degree project - Software Engineering Degree (UPM)
Repository to host the code and the memory of the final project of the degree in software engineering at the Higher Technical School of Computer Systems Engineering [ETSISI](https://www.etsisi.upm.es/) of the Polytechnic University of Madrid [UPM](https://www.upm.es/internacional/UPM/Historical%20Summary).
